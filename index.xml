      <description>Location We are going to be in the hotel, night and day. That is why, we have chosen the Hotel Continental in Rimini as our location for the unconference.
Since one of the important aspects of SoCraTes is being close to the “action”, everything will happen within the location: lodging, eating and mingling. As a result, we can only accept as many participants as the number of available beds.</description>
